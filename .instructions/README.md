# Project Instructions for AI Models

Welcome to this collaborative project! This folder contains essential guidelines and task breakdowns for AI models working on different parts of the system.

## 📋 Core Principles

### Work Philosophy

- **One task at a time** - Complete each TODO fully before moving to the next
- **No merge conflicts** - Careful coordination and incremental changes
- **No documentation dumps** - Don't write summary docs after completing tasks
- **Scalable architecture** - Design for growth from day one
- **Code clarity** - Everyone should understand the codebase

### File Organization

- **Create new files** when adding new features/components
- **Avoid editing existing files** unless absolutely necessary
- **Keep code modular** and well-structured
- **Separate concerns** into distinct files and folders

## 📁 Instruction Files

- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - High-level project vision and features
- **`WORKFLOW.md`** - How to work on this project
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System design and structure guidelines
- **`TODOS.md`** - Master task list (check off as you complete)
- **`CONVENTIONS.md`** - Coding standards and naming conventions
- **`TECH_STACK.md`** - Complete technology stack reference

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

1. **Always check off TODOs** after completion (use `[x]` in markdown)
2. **Never skip steps** - follow the task order
3. **Test before marking complete** - ensure your changes work
4. **Commit frequently** - small, atomic commits with clear messages
5. **Read all instructions** before starting any work

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` to understand what we're building
2. Read `WORKFLOW.md` to learn how to work on this project
3. Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system design
4. Reference `TECH_STACK.md` for technology choices
5. Check `TODOS.md` for available tasks
6. Follow `CONVENTIONS.md` while coding
7. Mark tasks complete as you finish them
